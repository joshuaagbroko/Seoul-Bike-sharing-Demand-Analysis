# Seoul-Bike-sharing-Demand-Analysis
Applied Data Science with R capstone Project

This research tries to analyze how weather would affect bike sharingdemand in urban areas. The dataset used in this analysis is from Seoul BikeSharing System, Open Weather API, World Cities, and Bike System in the World
•
We developed a predictive model to forecast bike demand under varying weather conditions by leveraging:
•
Historical weather
and
Bike Rental records from multiple cities.
•
By integrating weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, our model provide insights into how weather influences bike usage patterns
